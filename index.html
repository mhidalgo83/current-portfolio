            <p>
              This full-stack application was a contracted project, where I was lead developer, for the University of Kansas. The application was designed with helping those that may have barriers to employment in Wyandotte County. The remote, cross-discipline team aggregated various data sets, including social services, food pantries, education/training services, transit data, and employment opportunities. The front-end is built using React, Redux, Sass, Google Maps API, and the third-party React Google Maps API library to visualize our data. The back-end is built in Node, Express, and MongoDB. No code available, as this is proprietary intellectual property owned by the University of Kansas.

            <h4>Co-make</h4>
            <p>
              This application connects residents of specific communities together and gives them a platform to communicate any issues that they would like to see addressed. As lead front-end developer, I worked remotely with two junior developers and a back-end developer to help architect the back-end API, as well as coordinate and plan development of the front-end. We used React, Redux, and the Styled-Components API to develop the applicaton, as well as Cloudinary as cloud storage for user images.

            <h4>Disney Parent</h4>
            <p>
              Disney Parent is an application that connects parents to each other while in Disneyland to coordinate child-care, strollers, and time management. As the UI developer on the team, I was primarily responsible for the marketing page of the application. This is a static site that utilizes HTML, CSS, and LESS as the CSS pre-processor.
